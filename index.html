                    <p>Some of the mRNA vaccines being developed include the use of a material called a hydrogel, which might help disperse the vaccine slowly into our cells.</p>
                    <p>Bioengineers have used similar hydrogels for many years in different ways. For instance, they've used them to help stem cells survive after being put inside our bodies.</p>
                    <p>Because of this, some people believe that hydrogels are needed for electronic implants, which can connect to the internet.</p>
                    <p>The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines do not use hydrogels as a component.</p>

                    <p>There is evidence of a very small change to menstrual cycles in the month of vaccination.</p>
                    <p>A large study of women globally found COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a small and temporary change to their menstrual cycle. The women’s menstrual cycle was less than a day longer on average, but there was no change in the length of their period (bleeding). These changes end as soon as the next menstrual cycle after receiving the vaccine.</p>

                    <h2>No, COVID-19 vaccines do not alter your DNA.</h2>
                    <p>Some COVID-19 vaccine use a fragment of messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct your body to make an immune response against COVID-19. </p>
                    <p>There is a crucial difference between mRNA and DNA.</p>
                    <p>DNA, which makes up our genetic code, is larger, double stranded and very long. The mRNA is a single stranded copy of a small part of the DNA, which is often released to send instructions to other parts of the cell. </p>
                    <p>DNA is stored in the protected centre of our cells – the nucleus. The mRNA is broken down quickly by the body. It never enters the nucleus, and cannot affect or combine with our DNA in any way to change our genetic code. </p>
                    <p>Instead, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines teach the cell how to make a protein that triggers an immune response specific to COVID-19. The vaccines work with the body’s natural defences to develop immunity to disease.</p>

                    <h2>It may seem vaccines were developed quickly, but that is not the case.</h2>
                    <p>COVID-19 vaccines have been developed without compromising quality, safety and effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>It may appear they have been developed very quickly, but researchers around the world have been working hard to develop COVID-19 vaccines from the earliest stages of the pandemic.</p>
                    <p>They have been able to speed up development of vaccines thanks to the collaboration between them, scientists, manufacturers and distributors.</p>
                    <p>The development and implementation planning phases have been run side-by side, instead of one after the other. This has been made possible because of unprecedented global funding.</p>
                    <p>In addition, research into how to respond to a pandemic has been occurring long before COVID-19. This research looks at data from previous coronaviruses such as SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, giving researchers a head start when it comes to building the COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
                    <p>In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or the TGA, has been rigorously assessing the potential COVID-19 vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness. They will continue to do this with all vaccines before they will be approved and made available to Australians.</p>
                    <p>Once approved, each batch must also be checked to make sure it meets the same quality standards.</p>

                    <h2>The TGA will not approve a vaccine for use in Australia unless it is safe and effective. This includes impacts on fertility.</h2>
                    <p>There is no scientific evidence to support this. None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently under review by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) cause sterilisation/infertility.</p>
                    <p>The theory that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility is based on the disproven idea that one of the spike proteins in COVID-19 and the Syncytin-1 protein (which help placenta development) are the same. They are not.</p>
                    <p>The COVID-19 vaccine, like other vaccines, works by training our bodies to develop antibodies to fight against the virus that causes COVID-19, to prevent future illness.</p>
                    <p>There is currently no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta. In addition, there is no evidence suggesting that fertility problems are a side effect of ANY vaccine.</p>
                    <p>People who are trying to become pregnant now or who plan to try in the future may receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them.</p>

                    <h2>Vaccine protection increases in the days following your dose.</h2>
                    <p>You may not have the best protection until 7–14 days after the final dose recommended for your age group or individual health needs.</p>
                    <p>To receive the best protection against serious illness or death from COVID-19, You should stay up to date with all vaccinations recommended for your age or individual health needs.</p>
                    <p>The ATAGI recommended doses and vaccines outlines which vaccines and doses are recommended for each age and population group.</p>
                    <p>Whilst partial protection against COVID-19 may be as soon as 12 days after the first dose, this protection is likely to be short lived.</p>
                    <p>The final dose in the primary course encourages the body to create stronger protection (immunity) against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7-14 days after this dose.</p>
                    <p>Booster doses will make sure the protection from your primary course of COVID-19 vaccines is even stronger and longer lasting.</p>
                    <p>ATAGI recommends a 2023 COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for adults in the following groups:</p>
                    <p>- All adults aged 65 years and over</p>
                    <p>- Adults aged 18-64 years who have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of sever COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs.</p>
                    <p>If you have had your last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection, whichever is the most recent, you should wait 6 months until you consider a 2023 booster dose.</p>

                    <p>Clinical trials are currently happening to find out if we will need booster doses on an annual or longer basis.</p>
                    <p>What we do know is that evidence shows that all of the COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Australia prevent severe disease, people going to hospital and dying.</p>
                    <p>Protection against getting infected does appear to wane over time. Protection against death and severe disease also drops over time, but more slowly. You can increase your protection by getting a booster from 6 months after your primary course.</p>
                    <p>All adults can get a booster if it’s been 6 months or longer since their last COVID-19 booster or confirmed infection (whichever is most recent) for additional protection against severe illness from COVID.</p>
                    <p>Children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 with health conditions that put them at risk of severe illness can also get a booster dose if it’s been 6 months since their last dose or COVID-19 infection, based on an individual risk assessment with their immunisation provider.</p>
                    <p>Booster doses are not recommended at this time for children and adolescents aged 18 years or under who do not have any risk factors for severe COVID-19.</p>
                    <p>The aim of Australia’s COVID-19 vaccination program is to reduce COVID-19 related harm. Vaccines do this by preventing serious illness and death, and, as much as possible, transmission of the virus that causes disease.</p>

                    <h1>Do kids need to get vaccinated if they don’t get severely ill from COVID-19?</h1>
                    <h2>Some children do get severely sick from COVID-19, or experience long-term complications.</h2>
                    <p>Vaccination is the best way to help prevent your child getting sick. This is particularly important for children at greater risk.</p>
                    <p>There are many reasons why you may choose to get your child vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>
                    <p>Less is known about the effects of the Omicron variant in children.</p>
                    <p>Another reason you might consider vaccination is because of the indirect benefits to your child. Vaccination might help prevent school closures and disruptions to extra-curricular activities. School and activities are important for kids’ general wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>Vaccination of children could also help your family and community through reduced spread of the virus.</p>
                    <p>Vaccination in children is effective and safe. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will not approve a vaccine for use in Australia unless it is safe and effective.</p>
                    <p>Results of a recent clinical trial demonstrate that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are highly effective and that most side effects are mild and short-term.</p>
                    <p>The TGA carefully evaluated available data for both vaccines to support their safety and efficacy among children.</p>
                    <h2>If your child has had COVID-19</h2>
                    <p>If your child has had COVID-19 you should wait 3 months after the confirmed infection before they have a COVID-19 vaccine dose.</p>
                    <p>This is to optimise their vaccine protection. A longer gap between infection and vaccination is likely to lead to a better immune response and result in longer protection from reinfection.</p>
                    <p>The next scheduled dose of COVID-19 vaccine should be given as soon as possible after 3 months. Your child should still have all the recommended doses.</p>
                    <p>If your child has had COVID-19, you do not need to defer other vaccinations – for example, the flu vaccine. But they should not get any vaccine if they are acutely unwell.</p>
                    <p>If you have further questions, we encourage you to speak with your usual health care provider.</p>

                    <h2>People who have had COVID-19 and recovered should still be vaccinated. The protection someone gains from having COVID-19 varies from person to person.</h2>
                    <p>If you have had COVID-19 you should wait to be vaccinated with your next COVID-19 vaccine 6 months after the confirmed infection.</p>
                    <p>This is to optimise your vaccine protection. A longer gap between infection and vaccination is likely to lead to a better immune response and result in longer protection from reinfection.</p>
