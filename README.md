## Assignment 3 for unit 11055 - Programming for Design - u3179242 - Lachlan Duck

### FEATURES:
Key features include:

- A sectioned navigation that allows the user to quickly access their desired grouping of questions.
- A series of collapsible containers that hide information until the user interacts with them.
- The original webpage had small bits of information spread across many webpages. This website aims to consolidate the information to improve accessibility.

Initially, I wanted to include more features, one of which was a parallax background in the mid-section (the white background space) that would expand when the user opens more questions. Another idea was to have a collapsible sidebar to serve as the navigation/main feature, allowing the user to navigate directly to their question. Unfortunately, time constraints, combined with slow learning and implementation, limited the possibilities. Nevertheless, the process was enjoyable, albeit somewhat slow.

### ISSUES:
Key issues include:

- Too simple. While color, positioning, and typography are all key elements of a minimalist design, this website did not convincingly achieve it. Additional styling and features are needed to enhance the user's experience.
- Too little features. Particularly the use of Javascript effects, doing so would improve the interactivity of the website, which in turn, would creat a more engaging website for users.

I intentionally chose to stick to a single effect in earlier phases of the design to accommodate slow implementation, as I am not a strong coder. However, I did plan to add additional features if I had the time. Ultimately, more thorough styling planning before starting to code would have significantly expedited production, allowing more time to implement additional Javascript effects.
